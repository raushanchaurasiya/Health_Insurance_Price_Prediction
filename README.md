# Health_Insurance_Price_Prediction
  Predicting Health Insurance Price for an individual or family.     The majority of the countries finalize health insurance costs based on many factors such as age, number of people in families, etc. What should be the actual health insurance price for an individual or a family is an issue for many companies. Hence, one insurance company hired me as a data scientist to predict the health insurance cost for possible future customers. They have already collected samples required to perform all data analysis and machine learning tasks. I have performed all data analysis steps and finally created a machine learning model which can predict the health insurance cost.
